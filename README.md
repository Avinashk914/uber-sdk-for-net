# Uber SDK for .NET

This SDK provides an easy way for .NET developers to build C# or VB applications that interact with the [Uber API](https://developer.uber.com/).

This SDK is built using the Async/Await pattern for asynchronous development and .NET portable class libraries, making it easy to target multiple Microsoft platforms, including .NET 4.5, Windows Phone 8, Windows 8/8.1, and iOS/Android using Xamarin and Mono.NET.

## NuGet Package

You can try the SDK immmediately by installing the [WadeWegner.Uber](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WadeWegner.Uber/) NuGet package.

    Install-Package WadeWegner.Uber
